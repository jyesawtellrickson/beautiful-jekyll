It's rare that you see someone pull out this small accessory most often associated with conspicuous consumption - thanks Wolf of Wall Street(?). The typical money clip is gold-plated, shiny and has some sort of symbolism shoving the power of capitalism down your throat. It's handled with little to no tact and helps you to show off the many dollar bills you currently wield. All in all, it's not something you want to be associated with (hopefully). 

That said, the money clip has a practical side too. Typically it can handle 3-5 cards and a few notes. "But it hasn't got any room for coins!" I hear you object. Well, neither should our society (link to coon retirement plan). Many payments are done via card and for those that don't, God gave you pockets for a reason. Compared to the average wallet, it's slim. Forget ultraslim leather arrangements, this piece of metal is thinner than a card and adds little bulk. Moreover, remember those coins you so vehemently defended? Gone. Those receipts you stuff your wallet with? Moved to a better place. The money clip forces you to be efficient and that's a good thing. A final benefit which can't be overstated is the one-handed card removal. Ever needed your card quickly but was carrying something in the other hand? What a conundrum! With the money clip, one can master a technique which allows you to extract a card in seconds, all without your money and cards ever leaving your pocket.
