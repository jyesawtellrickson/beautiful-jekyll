Every industry is dominated by business. The principle goal of business is to generate revenue. Thus our world is optimised towards generating money, not necessarily value. Instead of businesses, I want to create companies whose goals are to add value first, create money second. Value comes at two main levels: 1. Physics based, arbitrary improvements or decisions*, e.g. more food, cleaner water and 2. Subjective, feelings based, e.g. arts and cultural value. 


We can start by looking on an industry level and setting realisable and measurable goals. 

Energy: generate enough energy to meet the world's current and future needs completely through renewable sources. 

Transport: Minimise average travel time across the network whilst maintaining energy at a reasonable level.

Media: Disseminate news in the quickest, most arbitrary manner. 

Food: Provide healthy food to all. 

Construction: Build safe structures which blend with the natural environment. 

Finance: Securely manage wealth with as little overhead as possible. 

Water: Provide clean and healthy water. 

Communications: Allow instant and secure communication between any parties. 

*NB. There will always be argumentns against, as is customary in science, but the popular consensus within the learned community should be the driving factor
