Around the world, McDonalds has rolled out automated ordering systems that allow users to purchase their food without having to interact with a teller. These are great because they reduce the wages required to pay staff and pay themselves off in less than 50 days. But with this technology, more can be done.

Everyone loves that feeling of walking into their favourite cafe where the waiter recognises you and asks, do you want the regular? This feeling of customisation is something you don't get at fast food restaurants where customers almost feel like they're passing through an assembly line. It would be great to change that and bring back the local feel / emotion to the fast food industry.

Secondly, while the touchscreen technology is great, it still has its limitations. In particular, navigation can be a little bit painful and time consuming while you wait for feedback from the system. Reducing the time spent here could help in overall operational performance.

So how do we fix this?

# The Perfect Checkout
The steps of choosing your order could be removed by using facial recognition to remember the user and automatically setup their new order. Imagine the flow, user approaches the machine, taps to start, instantly they're shown their last order in a pop-up which with just one tap, takes them to their preferred payment. Suddenly the steps of choosing their meal, their size, their drink, their add-ons and their payment method is reduced to one-click. This is a huge time saver, bringing the transaction time down from 1-2 minutes to under 30 seconds (2-4x). This would mean a reduction in machines of the same factor (if everyone was a regular customer) which is a reduction is sunken cost, as well as operation / maintenance cost.

# Extending on This

## Cross-Store
The beauty of this is that the data could be hosted in the cloud, meaning if a user wanders into a different store while they're out you can apply the same methodology and offer them their preferred meal. This could eventually be extended to anywhere in the country, or anywhere in the world. Imagine walking into a McDonalds in Beijing and automatically getting the same as your order in New York.

## Upsell
I don't know about you, but I (occasionally, yes, occasionally) treat myself to an ice cream or an apple pie. If you tracked my spending behaviour, you'd probably see that I'm more likely to purchase that ice cream on a Friday after a long week of work. By tracking spending habits with the new data collection method it would be possible to make that suggestion and offer me the right products at the right time.

## Mood
Following on from the treat recommending, one might also notice that when I'm unhappy I'm more likely to buy an ice cream, and I just need a little push over the edge (who cares right now!). Using machine learning, it is possible to detect the mood of a person based off their face. Admittedly, people probably don't seem too excited when ordering food, but there is still a scale and with emotion detection it could be possible to again offer the right products at the right time.

## Outfit
If I'm in my exercise clothes (recognise nike logo, generic outfit), I might care more about healthy food - or the other way - I'm ready to binge. Making suggestions based off this data source could improve the user experience.

## Loyalty
I've never seen a McDonald's loyatly scheme, maybe that's because the food is so addictive they don't need one. Either way, with a more machine-based ordering system and data based approach, a loyalty system could be introduced to promote repetitive purchases.

# Adoption
Adoption of the system may be difficult. I know I'm not a big fan of companies storing my data in the cloud and my purchasing history (especially not my binge eating!). However, as part of the rollout system, the feature could be introduced at the start of the purchase, with all it's benefits and offering a straight up discount for using the feature, e.g. Opt-in and allow us to recognise your face to improve your ordering experience etc. AND receive a 5c discount off this order. Then once a user is opted in, they are unlikely to opt-out which could be a feature on the machine, or via form submission (as difficult as possible).


Honestly, there is so much that big fast food chains could be doing with the volumes of people and high recurrency. It's only a matter of time before the above are implemented but right now we're at a point where the technology is ready and the costs are justified - so let's get building!
