Cartoons as a replacement for religion. Religion taught us morals and how to act, now we watch cartoons /TV for that.

 Lecture note analyser  - can we extract the focus of a lecture from the notes. What are the main topics? How much time does the lecturer spend on these? What do we expect the focus for examination to be?
Link with live self-recording to check yourself for how you're working. Direct feedback to lecturer
Compare top-level analysis of different instutions - can this make comments about the institution?

Higher Education polling bot
Goal of bot is to let the lecture know how their material is being received.
App streams what lecturer is saying to identify topics they are talking about or has a collection of pre-selected ones (by the lecturer?). Students then open the app and select the topic from the bubble and put confusion face to indicate they don't get it. Can add text / questions if need be. Also standard responses.
Display the information in a smart way to the lecturer and they can live watch as confusing topics grow in strength and then refocus attention. Can also try to do smart things with the questions student ask.
Could also plug in with student forums.
Most applicable to big classes 100+.
Each class has a random identifier: www.classmon.com/standford-ml/xOEO3
students can simply navigate to the higher level url e.g. stanford-ml and this will give the option for the latest class
Can we guess the focus of a lecture from the lecture notes? Could be a cool nlp project.
